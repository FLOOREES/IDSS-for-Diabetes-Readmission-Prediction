    "# Diabetes Readmission Prediction Pipeline Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a convenient interface to execute the `src/run.py` pipeline script directly from within the `src/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `src/run.py` script is designed to be run as a Python module using `python -m src.run <args>` from the *project's root directory* (the directory containing the `src/` folder). This ensures that Python correctly resolves module paths and relative imports (like `from . import config`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing `src/run.py` directly (e.g., `python run.py`) from within `src/` or running `python -m src.run` from within `src/` can lead to `ImportError` issues because the script is not run in the correct package context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, this notebook uses Python's `subprocess` module to execute the `python -m src.run` command, explicitly setting the current working directory (`cwd`) to the project root. This accurately simulates the intended command-line execution environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is structured into several cells:\n",
    "1.  **Environment Setup:** Imports necessary libraries, determines the project root path, and defines a helper function `run_src_script` to handle execution via `subprocess`.\n",
    "2.  **Default Execution:** Runs the pipeline with default configuration (equivalent to `$ python -m src.run`).\n",
    "3.  **Force Train Autoencoder:** Runs the pipeline forcing autoencoder retraining (equivalent to `$ python -m src.run --train-ae`).\n",
    "4.  **Force Train Predictor:** Runs the pipeline forcing predictor retraining (equivalent to `$ python -m src.run --train-predictor`).\n",
    "5.  **Force Train Both:** Runs the pipeline forcing both autoencoder and predictor retraining (equivalent to `$ python -m src.run --train-ae --train-predictor`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the cells sequentially or individually as needed."
